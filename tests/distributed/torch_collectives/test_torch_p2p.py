# fabric. ring_batch runs that same pair through batch_isend_irecv, the documented way to
# get a bidirectional exchange without the stream-ordering deadlock, and the only mode that
# can plausibly use both directions at once. batch posts world-1 sends and world-1 recvs in
# a single batch_isend_irecv: a
# hand-rolled alltoall carrying the same traffic as test_torch_alltoall through a
# different entry point, which is the axis every bug found so far has turned on.
